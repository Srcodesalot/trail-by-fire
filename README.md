# Trial by Fire
Trial by fire is a text based adventure game ... for now.
This project utilizes Java and JavaFX.

# Game Description
Int this game you play as a young person who has lost thier family and must go on a journey to find them.
along the way you will fight enemies and have to make decisions on which "paths" to take.

# Battle
Battles mechanics here are modeled much like D&D mechanics.
basically the player and the enemy roll a dye and who ever has the higher number wins that attack.
Damage dealt is the difference between the each players rolls.

however some defences nullafy attacks.
dodge beats strong attack
block beats quick attack

however since you roll for damage even if you dodge on a quick attack your dodge can still work.
if you roll higher than the enemy your dodge will be be successful and vice versa.

# CONTRIBUTION

# Story
first off this is a great platform for any text base adventure game
if you have an idea of a cool story you'd like to play through you can add it to the story class!
if the plat form gets big enough we may have to make multiple story classes (like game cartridges)
